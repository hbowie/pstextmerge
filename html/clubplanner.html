<h1>PSTextMerge Club Planner Data</h1><p><em><a href="powersurgepub.html#input">PSTextMerge User Guide</a></em></p><p>Information about events and other items for club consideration are stored in text files, with one event/item per file. </p><p>Note that there are two variants of this file, one labeled &#8220;Club Planner&#8221; and the other labeled &#8220;Club Notes&#8221;. The first has only one row per event, while the second has one row per note header in the Notes field for each event.</p><h2>Folder Structure</h2><p>The text files should be organized into folders whose names provide additional data about the items.</p><p>The event files should be placed into something like the following folder structure. </p><ul>    <li><em>Club Name 2011 - 2012</em> &#8212; A folder containing all events for the club operating year, with both starting and ending year included in the folder name.        <ul>            <li><em>Events</em> &#8212; A folder containing all the event info. Other folders at this level may be used to store other information. Folders at the next level indicate status, and the following folder names are suggested.                <ul>                    <li><em>Archive</em> &#8212; For events that have already occurred and are no longer of current interest.</li>                    <li><em>Board</em> &#8212; Items of interest to the board of directors.</li>                    <li><em>Current</em> &#8212; Items of current interest.</li>                    <li><em>Future</em> &#8212; Items being considered for the future, but not yet of current interest.</li>                    <li><em>News</em> &#8212; Items to be reported in the next Email newsletter.</li>                    <li><em>Save</em> &#8212; Items being saved for possible consideration.</li>                </ul>            </li>        </ul>    </li></ul><p>The text files themselves consist of a series of field names, each followed by a colon, and then followed by the field data on the same and/or successive lines. </p><h2>Template</h2><p>The following lines can be used as a template for creating a Club Planner event. </p><pre><code>    /*        Fill out this form for a new event, then save it with the name of the event.
