# Template Library

These are notes on how the template library is used by the text merge modules. 

## Preferences

A 'templates-folder' value is stored for each recent file in the user's saved preferences (in the preferences plist file, on a Mac). 

## App Folder

If a folder named 'templates' exists within the applications appfolder, then this will be set as the template library at program startup, by the main class. 

## TextMergeTemplate class -- com.powersurgepub.psdatalib.textmerge

The TextMergeTemplate module "owns" the templateLibrary variable. Other modules should use this module's getters and setters to access this variable. 

During construction, the template library will be set to a user preference, if one exists. Otherwise, if the main class has a valid templates folder within its appfolder, then that location will be used. 

## FileSpec class -- com.powersurgepub.psfiles

The FileSpec class in the psfiles package contains a templatesFolder variable, and this is a pseudonym for the templateLibrary variable. The FileSpec module is responsible for saving and retrieving the preferred templateLibrary value for each source file. 

## ScriptAction class -- com.powersurgepub.psdatalib.script

This class will check to see if a file path lies within the template library and, if it does, will replace the template library path with the constant '#TEMPLATES#', so that this can be expanded using the current template library path when the script containing the path is later played back.
