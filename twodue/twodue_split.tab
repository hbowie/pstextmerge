Following the precedent set by the PSRenamer product, I am now calling this product PSTextMerge.		N/A	0	-1	-1	2005-04-09	Action	0	 	 	<a href='tags/marketing.html' rel='tag'>Marketing</a>

New Function	New Function					05/07/2005	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	2	9		3.1	Added Outline Format		Added a new data input format, called PSPub Outline. This format allows an outline to be easily created within any text editor. Any character may be used consistently within a file as a bullet character, to indicate a heading item. Indention is used to indicate outline levels. The output may then be formatted as HTML, in any format that the user chooses.	opguide/input.html#outline	N/A	0	-1	-1	2005-05-07	Action	0	 	 	<a href='tags/new-function.html' rel='tag'>New Function</a>

Minor Enhancement	Minor Enhancement					05/17/2005	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	3	9		3.1	Add Template Library		Added a template library. This defaults to a new templates folder in the PSTextMerge application folder. A new button on the Template tab allows you to select another folder to contain your collection of standard templates. Another new button on the Template tab allows you to open a template from the template library, rather than the folder where the input data file, or script file, resides. Recording a script that references a file from the template library will store the folder location as the template library, so that moving the template library will not later break scripts that have been recorded. In combination with the ability to reference the dataparent folder as a variable, and call out the data file name as a base file name (without a file extension), templates may now be written (and are supplied with the PSTextMerge standard distribution), that can be used with any appropriate data file, and will generate output in the data file's location, and with the data file's name (rather than hard-coding a specific output file name in each template file).	opguide/template.html#templatelib	N/A	0	-1	-1	2005-05-17	Action	0	 	 	<a href='tags/minor-enhancement.html' rel='tag'>Minor Enhancement</a>

This command allows you to include text from another file into the output stream being generated by the template. The included text is not processed in any way, but is simply copied to the output file(s) being generated. This does allow output from a previous step in a script to be included in the output generated by a later step. If an include file is not found, then it will simply be skipped and processing will continue, with a log message to note the event.

So whereas IFNEWGROUP indicates a new value in the group identifier field for a particular level, IFNEWLIST indicates the start of a new sequence of values. In general, IFNEWLIST and IFENDLIST can be used to insert begin list and end list tags when generating HTML.

An outline heading may now have such a hyperlink applied, as well.		N/A	0	-1	-1	2005-07-27	Action	0	 	 	<a href='tags/minor-enhancement.html' rel='tag'>Minor Enhancement</a>
