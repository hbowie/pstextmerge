Introduction
------------

PSTextMerge merges lists of tabular data into text templates to create fully populated text files. The output files can be Web pages, XML files, RSS Feeds or any other varieties of text files. The input data can be obtained from a tab-delimited data file, or directly from a Microsoft Excel (&#8216;.xls&#8217;) spreadsheet, or from a number of other sources. You can record and easily play back recorded scripts, making it easy to re-generate your output text files when your data changes.

The input data can be sorted and filtered before being used to generate output, and these operations can be scripted as well.  

Tab-delimited files can be easily exported from most spreadsheets, databases, address book, and many other programs.

PSTextMerge can also perform other operations with tabular data, extracting and merging data from multiple bookmarks files, address books, and other formats. 

PSTextMerge was formerly known as TDF Czar.
